# GPD-Win-Max-3733MHz-Unlocked-BIOS

Hey dudes, if you just want to unlock some feature and you are not familiar with how to recover your bios, it is totally not worth to have a try, there are many other ways to change the setting in an UEFI environment, think about it carefully, just leave it there, go and enjoy the sun, it is not a good deal to torture yourself.

This repo contains an unlocked bios file.

The memory speed is 3733 MHz.

The bios version is 1.16, bios features are unlocked.

By download this bios file you agree to flash this unlocked bios to your device at your own risk.

Remember always fully backup your original bios: fptw64.exe -d fullbackup.rom

And copy the backup file to a thumb drive.

In case if there is any accident, the device can be recovered through chip programmers and chip test clips.

It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the official 1.16 bios from GPD before flashing this unlocked bios.

The chipset driver may need to be installed to make fptw64.exe run properly, also the "Core Isolation" function needs to be disabled if enabled previously (disabled by default in Windows 10).

Do not force power off while the bios flash is under programming.

To flash this unlocked bios: fptw64.exe -f WINMAX.1.16.MOD.rom -bios

Good luck.
