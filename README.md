Remember always fully backup your original bios: fptw64.exe -d fullbackup.rom
And copy the backup file to a thumb drive.
In case if there is any accident, the device can be recovered through chip programmers and chip test clips.
It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the official 1.16 bios from GPD before flashing this unlocked bios.
The chipset driver may need to be installed to make fptw64.exe run properly, also the "Core Isolation" function needs to be disabled if enabled previously (disabled by default in Windows 10).

Do not force power off while the bios flash is under programming.

To flash this unlocked bios: fptw64.exe -f WINMAX.1.16.MOD.rom -bios

Good luck.
